# iOS-Privacy-Guide

**There are some changes within the latest version of iOS (15) released in September of 2021. Any time a new major version is 
released, I currently recommend the iPhone SE (2nd Generation) if you are considering the purchase of a new Apple device.
 It is the most recent version which offers fingerprint support (instead of Face ID), and is quite affordable. 
 The following guide walks you through my considerations when configuring iOS 15, including scenarios for any user. 
 Please read and understand the entire guide before you take any action. First, choose the appropriate option for you 
 (three options).**

### Option I: An updated device with same Apple ID

You may simply want to update your current device to iOS 15 and apply these privacy configurations. 
This can be beneficial if you do not care about switching to a new Apple ID and want to keep your current app configurations 
(especially paid apps). This is not my choice, but I respect it for those who are concerned more about security than privacy 
from Apple. Conduct the following on your current device. Skip this section if you want to establish a new Apple ID.

    Settings>General>Software Update
    Confirm update request
    Reboot to complete installation
    Turn on device
    Click "Continue"
    Click "Don't Share" iPhone Analytics
    Click "Continue" and "Get Started"
    Check Settings>Apple ID Account>iCloud and confirm it is "Off" 
    If "On", consider disabling or the tutorial in Secition VI 
    Continue to Section IV

### Option II: A formatted device and new Apple ID

The following steps assume you wish to "start over" with an iPhone which already has an Apple ID, and you want to reset the 
device and switch to a new Apple ID. All steps assume you will be creating a new Apple ID for your new device and that you 
do not have any apps which you cannot reinstall easily (consider paid apps). 
Apple will know that the same device was used by the two accounts, but data collection will be isolated between each Apple ID.

    Update current device with "old" Apple ID to iOS 15
    Settings>General>Software Update
    Continue through prompts and reboot
    Backup the device to a local computer (Mac or iTunes)
    Settings>Apple Account>Sign Out
    Settings>General>Transfer or Reset iPhone>Erase All Content and Settings
    Allow phone to erase and reboot
    Select language and region, then click "Set Up Manually"
    Select and join available Wi-Fi
    Click "Continue"
    Set up Touch ID if desired
    Click "Passcode Options" and choose "Custom Numeric Code"
    Create a strong passcode and click "Next"
    Confirm passcode and click "Next"
    Choose "Don't transfer data and apps"
    Click "Forgot password or don't have an Apple ID"
    Choose "Set Up later" in Settings
    Choose "Don't Use"
    Agree to the terms of service
    Click "Continue" or "Customize Settings"
    Choose "Not Now" for "iMessage and Facetime"
    Choose "Disable Location Services"
    Choose "Setup Later in Settings" (Siri)
    Choose "Setup Later in Settings" (Screen Time)
    Click "Don't Share" iPhone Analytics
    Select desired appearance and zoom
    Click "Get Started" to exit the menu
    Continue to Section IV
### Option III: A brand new device

If you purchased a new device, this is a great opportunity to establish a new Apple ID and prepaid cellular account in order 
to stop the tracking of your old accounts and restart the data collection process with anonymous details. 
Conduct the following on your new device.

    Turn on device
    Select language and region, then click "Set Up Manually"
    Select and join available Wi-Fi
    Click "Continue"
    Set up Touch ID if desired
    Click "Passcode Options" and choose "Custom Numeric Code"
    Create a strong passcode and click "Next"
    Confirm passcode and click "Next"
    Choose "Don't transfer data and apps"
    Click "Forgot password or don't have an Apple ID"
    Choose "Set Up later" in Settings
    Choose "Don't Use"
    Agree to the terms of service
    Click "Continue" or "Customize Settings"
    Choose "Not Now" for "iMessage and Facetime"
    Choose "Disable Location Services"
    Choose "Setup Later in Settings" (Siri)
    Choose "Setup Later in Settings" (Screen Time)
    Click "Don't Share" iPhone Analytics
    Select desired appearance and zoom
    Click "Get Started" to exit the menu
    Confirm iOS 15 is installed at Settings>General>About>Software Version

### If the device has iOS 14 installed, Update to iOS 15 with the following:

    Settings>General>Software Update
    Reboot to complete installation
    Repeat through prompts using the previous instructions
    Continue to Section IV
    If the device has iOS 15 installed, Continue to Section IV
    
### Section IV: iOS Configuration

This section should apply to all three options previously presented. Once you have iOS 15 installed and booted, the following configurations should be 
considered through the Settings menu. Note that some of these settings may disable features which you find desirable, and some options here might not 
be present within your device. Research any modifications and apply settings appropriate for you.

    Settings>Wi-Fi: Off (If not used-preferred)
    Settings>Bluetooth: Off (If not used-preferred)
    Settings>Cellular: Disable access to apps which don't need data, such as Find My, Contacts, etc.

    Mail, Notes, Reminders, News, TV, Stocks, etc.
    Change wallpaper
    Remove unwanted Widgets from screens
    Remove unwanted apps from home screen
    Create new app shortcuts if desired
    Rearrange desired apps

### Section VI: Apple ID

If you began at sections II (A brand new device) or III (A formatted device), you should now have an iPhone with iOS 15 and 
several custom configurations. However, you have not connected an Apple ID to your device yet. You cannot download any apps. 
I like to establish a new Apple ID at least once a year in order to slightly confuse Apple's data collection systems. 
I insist on a new Apple ID and prepaid cellular account any time I switch to a new device. In iOS 15, signing in through the 
standard Apple ID menu logs you into iCloud without an option to disable overall synchronization 
(you can only disable individual services). This is dangerous, especially after rebooting during an update. 
The following should bypass the mandatory iCloud option and establish a new Apple ID for your device. 
Users who began at Option I can skip this section.

    Open "App Store"
    Click "Continue"
    Click "Turn off Personalized Ads"
    Click Profile icon in upper right
    Click "Create New Apple ID"
    Provide (and document) desired Email and Password
    Provide (and document) desired Name and DOB
    Disable Apple Updates
    If prompted, choose "None" as payment type
    Insert desired Street number, City, State, and Zip
    Provide Mobile number and verify via text if prompted
    Verify email confirmation code if prompted

### Apple sees all of this data anyway. We are not as secretive as we might believe.

    Open Settings and notice your new Apple ID is present
    Click "Finish Setting Up Your iPhone" then "Finish Setting Up"
    If prompted, enter your PIN
    Click "Cancel" then "Back"
    If present, click "Start using iCloud", then "Not Now"
    Click your Apple ID account and confirm iCloud is "Off"
    Settings>Apple ID>Media & Purchases>View Account>Personalized Recommendations: Disable
    Settings>Apple ID>Rating & Reviews: Remove All
    Settings>Apple ID> iCloud: Disable all
    Settings>Apple ID>Find My>Share My Location: Disable
    Settings>Finish Setting Up Your Phone>Set Up Siri: Setup Later in Settings

After you have successfully signed into the App Store, but not iCloud, open the Find My app and confirm that it prompts you 
to sign in to an account (but don't sign in). This indicates that the basic abilities to track your device are disabled.

### Firefox Focus: This is my preferred default browser, and I take the following actions:

    Settings>Firefox Focus>Default Browser App: Firefox Focus
    Firefox Focus>Settings>Safari: Enable
    Firefox Focus>Settings>Send Usage Data: Disable
    Firefox Focus>Settings>Search Engine: DuckDuckGo
    Firefox Focus>Settings>Get Search Suggestions: Disable

### Signal: Signal needs some settings activated and deactivated. I take the following actions:

    Signal>Settings>Privacy>Default Timer: Set as desired
    Signal>Settings>Privacy>Hide Screen in App Switcher: Enable
    Signal>Settings>Privacy>Show Calls in Recents: Disable

### Protonmail: Regardless of your primary settings, the Protonmail iPhone app will add a footer at the end of every email announcing your usage on a mobile iOS device and set your default browser to Safari. I take the following actions:

    Protonmail>Settings>Account>Mobile Signature>Disable
    Protonmail>Settings>Default Browser: Firefox Focus

### ProtonVPN: if you plan to use both ProtonVPN (or any other VPN) and a firewall simultaneously, you must change the protocol of your VPN. Go to your settings and disable Smart Protocol. This allows you to change your VPN protocol to IKEv2 which will eliminate conflicts with most firewalls.

### Strongbox (https://strongboxsafe.com): This application opens KeePassXC databases. The biometric option to open databases is available with the paid version.

    Thank You.
